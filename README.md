These are my files from my high school Hunt the Wumpus competition. TM is the main Trivia Management file,
DF is the form which presents the questions to the user, and TF is the UI which I created for testing my
Trivia Management object. qs.xml is the file which I used to store preconfigured trivia questions which
the object then read in. In the midst of the project, I came up with the idea to try to make it so the 
object could create questions on its own using Wikipedia. This branched into my attempt at a Common Lisp
AI.
